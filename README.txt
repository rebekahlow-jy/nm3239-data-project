Hi there!

To run the code, ensure that you have Python installed in the system, and do the following:

1. Using Command prompt, navigate index.html in the project folder 
2. Type "python -m http.server 8080"
3. Keep the Python command running, and open your browser
4. Go to "http://localhost:8080/"
5. View webpage

That's all to run the program.

Cheers!
